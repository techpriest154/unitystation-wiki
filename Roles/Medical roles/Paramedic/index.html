    <h1 id="paramedic">Paramedic<a class="headerlink" href="#paramedic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p><strong>Role type</strong>: <font color= "#d673b2">Medical</font> . <strong>Access</strong>: <font color="#d673b2">Medbay</font>. <strong>Difficulty</strong>: <font color="Red">Extreme</font>.</p>
<p>Note: for the guide to ordinary doctoring and first aid treatment, check <a href="../Medical-Doctor/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mr-gurney">Mr. Gurney<a class="headerlink" href="#mr-gurney" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As the paramedic, you have one main job, heal people that attempt to keel over outside medbay. failing that, you should keep them alive long enough to get to medbay for proper
treatment. You are equal in rank to the geneticist, chemist, and other doctors, and need only take orders from the CMO and Captain. It is, however, often a good choice to prolong
your own existence by obeying sec within reason and leaving an area when ordered to by its director or workers. You should at all times carry a medkit (or medkits, in extreme
emergencies), a medical belt, and any manner of other healing gadgets you can feasibly store without pissing off the other doctors. It is also reccomended to wear you signature
paramedic coat, as it distinguishes you from other doctors.</p>
<h2 id="the-practice">The practice<a class="headerlink" href="#the-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When playing paramedic, there is little if any reason to stick around medbay, other doctors can handle that. your goal is to patrol the station looking for those that are close to
or past the point where they become a corpse, heal them if possible (and allowed, dont want to heal some nukie by accident do we now?) or drag them to med. Checking maint on 
occasion to locate any corpses stuffed within is reccomended, as is running into regions where combat or disaster is present or likely to occur. Maintaining a close relation and 
communication with sec and engineering is reccomended, the prior will be the most likely to get into fights and need patching, while the latter is both the most common cause and 
solution to structural failures.</p>
<p>In emergency situations, you have, unsurprisingly, among the most important roles of the whole crew. Sec officers cant fight xenos if they are bleeding out on the floor, and 
people cant run to evac if their legs have been blown apart. This is where you come in. Unlike the doctors, who will prioratize the dead for cloning the majority of the time, you
should isntead keep your attention to the injured outside medical and leave the dead for others to haul around. Fixing people up at the front line of either a disaster or battle
and sending them back off to fight it is typically far more efficient than hauling dead bodys back to medbay and returning. While you may think that the Paramedic would make a 
good rescuer when it comes to explosives and breaches, they arent, and are instead just as likely to keel over responding to them as anyone else. let the engineers and atmos techs
with their fancy hardsuits drag the corpses out for you instead and focus on healing those who barely made it out.</p>
<p>If everything is fucked well past the point of no return or hope, you should hunker down like everyone else and slowly maneuver your way to a shuttle of any sort. if you meet 
others, feel free to help them, but dont be a hero as youll more than likely die yourself, what with you being entirely unarmed and unarmoured. you cant heal others if you die,
so try to save yourself first and others second.</p>
