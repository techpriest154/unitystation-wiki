<p><strong>Role type:</strong> <font color= "Red"><a href="Antagonist.md">Antagonist</a></font>. <strong>Access:</strong> Whatever your selected <a href="Roles.md">Role</a> has. <strong>Difficulty:</strong><font color="Yellow"> Medium</font>-<font color="Red">hard</font>.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Traitor is one of the three types of Antagonist roles that can spawn, with the other two currently in the game being <a href="Nuclear-Emergency.md">Nuke Ops</a> and <a href="../../../Events/Cargonia/">Cargonia</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mission-specification-decrypted-welcome-syndicate-agent">MISSION SPECIFICATION DECRYPTED. WELCOME, SYNDICATE AGENT.<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-specification-decrypted-welcome-syndicate-agent" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As a Traitor, you spawn as the role you selected, with no visual distinction from everyone else. However, you are massively different from any other crew member: You're part of the <a href="../../../Lore/Groups/">Syndicate</a>. Maybe you're a hardcore follower of the Syndicate ways; maybe you're just some poor sap who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Either way, you have one job: <a href="../../../Other/Jokes/So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist/">|Complete your objectives without giving away your true identity.</a></p>
<p>Traitors get 3 objectives, shown at the round start in the chat: Steal a random high-tier item, assassinate a random crew member (often a department head), and survive untill the end of the round. An example of what your objectives could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steal the Chain of Command (found in the captain's quarters)</li>
<li>Assassinate Mr. Engineering man sir, <a href="../../Engineering%20roles/Chief-Engineer/">Chief Engineer</a></li>
<li>Escape on the <a href="Emergency-Shuttle.md">Emergency Shuttle</a> alive</li>
</ul>

<p>At the start of your round as traitor, you will be given a password that you must put on the ringtone changer in your PDA, that password is usually composed of three NATO alphabet letters separated by dashes, another dash and three numbers. When you open your PDA, you go to options and below where it says ringtone changer you enter the password. Then, you will get to a screen that has weapons. Be sure to have your off hand empty and the items you select will be teleported there. However, the items cost credits, and you have only 20 of those to start. The items that have been tested and proven to work are the guns and the ammo mags, take other items at your own risk (im only 100% sure explosives dont work however).</p>

<h2 id="the-treachery-tricks">The treachery tricks<a class="headerlink" href="#the-treachery-tricks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As a traitor, you must kill a person and get an item. In small rounds (little players, not all the roles covered), that means entering a high security area and sooting down a locker and killing someone. In big rounds it means killing a higher up and praying they have their item on them, and then killing some random dude. As the higher ups are usually at least half competent at the game, this is a hard task, not even taking into account security. However, there are some things you can do:</p>
<h3 id="get-a-gun">Get a gun<a class="headerlink" href="#get-a-gun" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The basic p90 pistol and as much ammo as you can is the blind pick, however you can also go with the more expensive gun and its ammo (im not sure if it works tho). If you manage to get the Justitia or the Imperitor, don't use them, they don't work for you because of a thing of access that I have no idea of how it works, but you will probably need their keycards or something. Also try to get as much ammo as you can, because it is really hard to get some on most stations.
If you run out of bullets DO NOT BUY ANOTHER GUN, the ammo boxes are way cheaper and have more rounds.</p>
<h3 id="dont-spend-all-of-your-money">Don't spend all of your money<a class="headerlink" href="#dont-spend-all-of-your-money" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Its UnityStation, you never know what is going to happen. You may have lost your gun or you just ran out of ammo. Usually saving money for later wont kill you, but not having any might.</p>
<h3 id="get-access">Get access<a class="headerlink" href="#get-access" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Your first task is to either get as much access as you can through the HoP, getting or stealing a card with all access or in the worst case getting a wire cutter, some wires and a screwdriver and start hacking open some doors. You need to go to all the places you can to get your items, and the captain's bedroom may be the place you need to be.</p>
<h3 id="make-others-grief">Make others grief<a class="headerlink" href="#make-others-grief" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As a traitor, your best trait is not that you can grief, but that you can make others grief. Recruit some people and be amazed of how many of them are willing to join the syndicate. People like to grief, and you are giving them the ultimate excuse to grief others, treachery. This works even in HRP servers of hardcore ss13, and will often go unpunished because of the power of friendship. Remember to try to convince people 1 on 1 if you can. I don't know why, but it seems to work best. Also beware, now they are traitors just as you, and they may betray you as well.</p>
<h3 id="be-polite">Be polite<a class="headerlink" href="#be-polite" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This may be the best advice you can take. Somehow, if you are polite people can even turn a blind eye on you TRYING TO MURDER THEM if they are not entirely aware of your status as a traitor. If there is no shitcurity this round, they are going to pick the mean guy, and you are not the mean guy, BECAUSE YOU ARE POLITE. You are a traitor, so you will have to betray them, but you can make them WANT to be betrayed, because you are such a nice guy, mostly because they are role playing, and you are making them feel better being betrayed than not.</p>
<h3 id="go-for-that-kill-but-not-in-public">Go for that kill, but not in public<a class="headerlink" href="#go-for-that-kill-but-not-in-public" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Get a good RP reason to make people you want to kill to be alone with you when you want to kill them and where you want to kill them. Preferably when the rest of the station is in chaos. You should space the person you killed if you can, because if they are cloned they may start "remembering" stuff from their past life.</p>
<h3 id="go-fast">Go fast<a class="headerlink" href="#go-fast" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Lag and people being distracted makes swift and effective actions often go unnoticed. If you are lucky and fast enough, you may even go through the entire command room, get to the captain bedroom and loot everything without being noticed.</p>
<h3 id="just-shoot">Just shoot<a class="headerlink" href="#just-shoot" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>People don't give a fuck about hearing a gunshot, its unitystation, thats part of the job and as long as you haven't seen any traitors shooting, the shot is far and not important. This is not among us and probably no one is going to check who was the "big bad traitor who killed my buddy", so don't wait for it, make your moment and role play your way out. This may not be Dwarf Fortress since losing is not fun always, but it can be if you get permajailed after a really good phoenix wright simulator in a space station.</p>
<h3 id="helpful-locations-and-how-to-get-there">Helpful locations and how to get there<a class="headerlink" href="#helpful-locations-and-how-to-get-there" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The lockers have to be shot down if you want to get whats inside of them and don't have access. Get a gun.</li>
<li>The Justitia is the HoS big laser gun and is on his locker on his office on security. He should have it on himself at all times (unless he´s VERY incompetent)</li>
<li>The Imperator is the Capitan's big laser gun and is on his locker on his bedroom on command. This gun is actually pretty good but not flawless nor critical to his role, so the captain should have it on himself but not always.</li>
<li>The chain of command is a chain whip on the captain's bedroom, he may or may not have it on him.</li>
<li>The nuclear disk is the thing you use to turn on the nuke to the side of the captain's bedroom (you also need a password, so don't try it unless you are nuke ops or similar). Its in the captain's bedroom, but he probably already took it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grief-and-have-fun">Grief and have fun<a class="headerlink" href="#grief-and-have-fun" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you don't want to do any hard work and just want to grief like a boss, you can. You are a traitor, anyway, so you can always argue its to "get your objectives done", because you need chaos to do so, and unitystation is always chaos (at least it should work in a MRP server). Kill that clown because you don't like him and BECOME the clown. Steal a plasma canister and blow half the station to pieces. You name it. You are the bad guy, you can always just roleplay a dick, but expect security to get you and put you into jail, or to die to the people you are trying to grief.</p>
